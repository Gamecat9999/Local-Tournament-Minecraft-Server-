# Local-Tournament-Minecraft-Server-
This is a presetup java/bedrock minecraft server with a custom Local Tournament Plugin that starts a ten minute timer where the players have to kill each other as much as possible. of course it also counts kills, displays a winner, and more!

download the zip file from here for a premade 1.21.8 server and extract it where you want it to go. You will need at least java 17 to run this server. this server also has a premade arena with limits made by barriers. it could use more work, but it will work. next you want to run the server.jar in terminal(on windows or linux) by using the cd command to open the folder and then java -jar server.jar nogui. this will start the server up. Next you want to launch minecraft and go to servers on either bedrock or java. On java the address will be your ip, which you can find by opening a new terminal and entering ipconfig . paste the ipv4 address into it and it should ping. for bedrock use the same ipv4 and use the default port. this DOES NOT tunnel to devices on the internet, but i do suggest playit.gg for free tunneling for java and bedrock. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I am also just dropping the custom tournament plugin into the files here so if you have a server already made just download it and drop it into your servers plugin files!
